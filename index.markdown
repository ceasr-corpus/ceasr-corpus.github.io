**CEASR** is a **C**orpus for **E**valuating the quality of **A**utomatic **S**peech **R**ecognition (ASR). It is a data set based on
public speech corpora, containing speech utterances along with their transcripts generated by several modern state-of-the-art
commercial and open-source ASR systems.

CEASR covers various speaking styles; a variety of
speakers’ demographic profiles related to gender, dialect
and mother tongue; various recording setups (microphone
types and recording environments); properties of the audio
signal (duration, sampling rate, number of channels, bit
depth, encoding and number of samples), as well as other
spoken utterance properties such as speaking rate, occurrence
of speaker noise (e.g. laughing) or filled pauses (such
as e.g. ”hm” or ”mhm”). Utterances in the corpus are provided
with a set of attributes reflecting all these dimensions.

To our knowledge, CEASR is the
first corpus where transcriptions of multiple ASR systems
are collected and published. This allows researchers to explore
the capabilities of ASR systems in various settings
without the tedious and time-consuming effort of creating
the transcriptions. References and hypotheses are provided in a
unified format, which facilitates the development of scripts
and tools for their processing and analysis.

CEASR can be used for many applications, e.g.:
* a reference benchmark for ASR quality tracking
* detailed error analysis (e.g. error typology by acoustic setting, development of alternative error metrics)
* detailed ASR quality evaluation (e.g. in relation to speaker demographic profiles or spoken language properties)
* improving ASR, for example by developing ensemble learning methods based on the output of different systems
