CEASR contains transcriptions of nine English and six German speech corpora
generated by seven different ASR systems.

Due to legal constraints, not all of the corpus references and
system hypotheses contained in CEASR corpus can be made publicly available.
We are also not allowed to publish the names of the commercial systems. These names are replaced with IDs
(an ID consists of a letter which stands for a system name and a digit which stands for the particular system configuration).

The publicly available part of the CEASR corpus is presented below.
